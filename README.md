# BP Auto sales Documentation

Will need final site map and sumaries for every part of the project.

Presentation Plan:

Jake will introduce himself and the team and what our overall project is and how we got to the final product. This should take less than a minute.
Levi can then talk about the general plan and texts being as realistic as possible, talking about the original write-up. "A big part of making the website realistic was the logos and pictures we used"
Levi will then turn the "spotlight" to Alex as he explains the process of designing the logos, taking up at most a minute.
Alex can then segway into talking about the pictures, which then Carter will take over and talk about how he found the pictures we used, how he credited the places he got the photos from, and it should only take a minute at most.
Jake and Alex will take over going into the coding of the website and how the links work, how the photos got implemented into the site, and anything they feel that should be mentioned. This section should take the longest, taking an upwards of 2 minutes.
